class CoresetMethod(object):
    """
    A base class for coreset selection methods in deep learning.

    This class provides a general framework for implementing different coreset selection methods.
    It handles basic initialization, such as storing the training dataset, calculating the size
    of the coreset, and storing relevant arguments. Subclasses should override the `select` method
    to implement specific coreset selection logic.

    Attributes:
        dst_train (Dataset): The training dataset from which the coreset will be selected.
        args (argparse.Namespace): Arguments containing various settings and configurations for
                                    the coreset selection method.
        fraction (float): The fraction of the dataset to be selected as the coreset. Must be
                          between 0 and 1.
        random_seed (int, optional): The seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility.
                                     Defaults to None.
        num_classes (int): The number of classes in the training dataset.
        index (list): A list to store the indices of the selected samples.
        n_train (int): The total number of samples in the training dataset.
        coreset_size (int): The number of samples to be selected for the coreset, computed as a
                            fraction of the total training dataset size.
